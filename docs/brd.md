# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## **Project Overview**

**Project Name**: Conversational RAG Application

**Project Description**: This project involves the creation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built using Python, Streamlit, and Docker. It demonstrates the incorporation of GenAI into the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) by enabling document processing, query-based retrieval, and text generation. The system supports business analysts, developers, testers, and architects in automating repetitive tasks and generating valuable insights from textual documents.

**Project Goals**:
- Streamline document-based workflows using AI-driven insights.
- Reduce manual effort in requirements analysis, test case generation, and architecture validation.
- Demonstrate a scalable architecture that integrates GenAI capabilities into SDLC processes.
